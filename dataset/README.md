### Data Preparation

You can obtain all the nine benchmarks from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZOYpTUa82_jCcxIdTmyr0LXQfvaM9vIy) provided in Autoformer. All the datasets are well pre-processed and can be used easily.

```
mkdir dataset
```
**Please put them in the `./dataset` directory**
